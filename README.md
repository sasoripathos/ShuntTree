# ShuntTree
Shunt Tree is a balanced tree structure aiming to support parallel programming in pure functional programming. The idea was proposed by [Morihata and Matsuzaki (2011)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2034773.2034791).

This project provides an implementation in Scala 3 and formally verify the correctness via the [Stainless verification framework](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lara/stainless)
